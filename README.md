At-Risk_Prediction

The middle part of the code is not run down sequentially, but needs to be run selectively. We will continuously improve the legibility of the code.

The IPYNB file is large and very long, so it is better running on a high-performance computer. When opened on a regular computer, there may be delay a long time or kernel is likely to die.
